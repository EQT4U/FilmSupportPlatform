# Deployment Checklist - Quick Fix Guide

## ❌ Current Issue
Your deployment failed because the .replit file is configured for development, not production.

## ✅ Solution Steps

### 1. Test Build (Already Working)
```bash
npm run build  # ✅ Verified working
npm start      # ✅ Verified working
```

### 2. Manual Deployment Configuration
Since the .replit file cannot be automatically updated, you need to:

1. **Click "Deploy" in Replit**
2. **In deployment settings, update:**
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build`
   - **Run Command**: `npm start` (NOT `npm run dev`)
   - **Environment Variables**: `NODE_ENV=production`
   - **Port**: 5000

### 3. Verification
After updating these settings, your deployment should work correctly.

## 🔧 What's Already Fixed
- ✅ Package.json scripts are correct
- ✅ Server code handles production mode properly
- ✅ Build process works and creates optimized files
- ✅ Static file serving is configured correctly

## ⚠️ Key Points
- **Never use `npm run dev` for deployment** - it's blocked for security
- **Always use `npm start` for production** - it sets NODE_ENV=production
- **The build command must run first** - it creates the dist/ folder

Your application is production-ready; you just need to update the deployment settings manually in the Replit interface.
